# AppSync Transformer Construct for AWS CDK

## Why This Package

In April 2020 I wrote a [blog post](https://www.trek10.com/blog/appsync-with-the-aws-cloud-development-kit) on using the AWS Cloud Development Kit with AppSync. I wrote my own transformer in order to emulate AWS Amplify's method of using GraphQL directives in order to template a lot of the Schema Definition Language. 

This package is my attempt to convert all of that effort into a separate construct in order to clean up the process. 

## How Do I Use It

## Versioning

I will *attempt* to align the major and minor version of this package with [AWS CDK], but always check the release descriptions for compatibility.

I currently support [![GitHub package.json dependency version (prod)](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/kcwinner/appsync-transformer-construct/@aws-cdk/core)](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk)
